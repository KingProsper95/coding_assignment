# üìΩÔ∏è Facebook Movie Network - Coding Assignment

This project solves a problem where you determine the **most popular movie** in a person‚Äôs Facebook-like social network ‚Äî considering **friends, friends of friends**, and so on.

It uses an object-oriented design in Python with **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** to traverse the network efficiently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- `Person`: Represents a user with a name, a list of liked movies, and a list of friends.
- `MovieNetwork`: Manages the people and uses **BFS** to explore the network and count movie occurrences.
- `test.py`: Creates a sample network, populates users and movies, and prints the most popular movie.
